# GitHub Pages Portfolio

It is now time to create your own portfolio website. You will use the Portfolio Website Template that your group
created. You will create a new repository on your **personal** GitHub account and copy the necessary files from the
group's Portfolio Website Template to your new repository. You will then adapt the website to your personal information
and preferences.

Once the website is ready, you will **submit the URL** of your new repository to the assignment on Canvas. If your
GitHub username is `johndoe`, the URL with your personal portfolio should be: https://johndoe.github.io/portfolio.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server on http://localhost:3000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## GitHub Actions

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment is triggered when a new
commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

## Your Task

1. Create a new repository on your personal GitHub account named `portfolio`. The repository should be public and should
   use https://github.com/Ensign-College/CS22-portfolio-template.git as the template repository.
2. Copy all the necessary files from your group's Portfolio Website Template and push it to the `main` branch of your
   new repository.
3. Adapt the website to your personal information and preferences.
